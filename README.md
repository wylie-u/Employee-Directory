# Employee Directory

# Description

This project creates an employee directory using React. 

Upon visiting the site, the user is presented with a table displaying their employee directory, along with the ability to search for an employee by a specific name or email. With the search functionality, once the user starts to type, the table filters the results and only displays employees based on the letters keyed. 

To generate the employee data, this project features the Random User API, which you can check out [here](https://randomuser.me/)!

Check out the deployed site [here](https://wylie-u.github.io/Employee-Directory/)!
